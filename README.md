Wavefront
=========

This is an Arduino module that defines the wavefront algorithm.

The plan is to use this for some sort of self-navigation for the
little robot guy.

Tests
-----

If you want to run the tests for the project, you must have CppUnit installed
in your environment. To build and run the tests you simply change your
current directory to the root of the project and type:

    make

The top-level makefile will fire up the test makefile and build/execute all the
tests. I would make it easier, but I don't have access to electrodes for
brain scanning.
